msgid "Tired of resizing, compressing, converting, optimizing and exporting images over and over again? Better Images is a plugin that automagically does this hard work for you. Just upload your original image into the media library and the plugin will produce an image that is both better looking and smaller in size. And it will also resize the original full resolution image to save space."

msgid "Convert image with CMYK color mode to RGB"
msgstr ""

#: better-images.php:274
msgid "CMYK color mode is used on images meant to be used in print. WordPress will not be able to compress the image so you will end upp with multiple variants of the image in different sizes, each of them weighing in at the same size in mega byte as the original full size image. Enable this feature to convert the image to RGB mode before any resizing or compression occurs."

#: better-images.php:287
msgid "We have tweaked the plugin to give you the best balance between quality and file size. However, feel free to experiment with the best compression level for your specific need. Keep in mind that we use a higher compression level than the WordPress default value to compensate for the sharpening of the image."
